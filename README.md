# DS3 Paper Reading Group

Welcome to the DS3 Paper Reading Group Repository. The goal of this group is to discuss relevant research in the field of Data Science, Statistics, and Machine Learning.
The vision is to get undergraduate students involved in the world of research and academia. The reading group meets every month and facilitates a discussion led by one of our academic representatives or speakers.
